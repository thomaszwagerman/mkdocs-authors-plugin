A custom MkDocs plugin designed to dynamically generate an "Authors" page for your documentation site from a simple YAML file. This allows you to easily manage and display information about contributors without manually updating Markdown files.

The YAML format is kept consistent with Material's ["Defining authors"](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/tutorials/blogs/navigation/#defining-authors), which enables blog post author attribution.

## Features

* **Dynamic Page Generation:** Automatically creates an `authors.md` page based on your `.authors.yml` file.

* **Configurable Paths:** Easily customize the input YAML file name and the output Markdown page name.

* **Rich Author Profiles:** Supports fields for name, ID, description, avatar, affiliation, email, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter links.

## Installation

You can install this plugin using `pip`:

```
pip install mkdocs-authors-plugin
```

If you are developing the plugin locally, navigate to the plugin's root directory (the one containing `pyproject.toml`) and install it in editable mode:

```
cd /path/to/your/mkdocs-authors-plugin/
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### 1. Configure `mkdocs.yml`

Add the `authors_plugin` to your `plugins` list in your `mkdocs.yml` file. You also need to include the `authors.md` page in your `nav` section.

```
# mkdocs.yml
site_name: My Awesome Docs

plugins:
  - search
  - authors_plugin:
      # Optional: specify the authors file if it's not .authors.yml
      # authors_file: my_custom_authors.yaml
      # Optional: specify the output page name if it's not authors.md
      # output_page: team.md

nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Authors: authors.md # This is the page that will be generated by the plugin
  - About: about.md
```

### 2. Create your `.authors.yml` file

Create an `.authors.yml` file in the root directory of your MkDocs documentation project (the same directory as `mkdocs.yml`). This file will contain the data for your authors.

The plugin expects a top-level `authors` key, under which each author is defined by a unique ID (e.g., `author_one`).

```
# .authors.yml
authors:
  author_one:
    name: Author One
    description: Owner
    avatar: headshot_one.png
    affiliation: British Antarctic Survey
    email: author.one@example.com
    github: authorone
    linkedin: author-one-profile
    twitter: author_one_dev
  author_two:
    name: Author Two
    description: Maintainer
    avatar: headshot_two.png
    affiliation: UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology
    # You can omit any fields not applicable to an author
  author_three:
    name: Author Three
    description: Core Contributor
    avatar: headshot_three.png
    affiliation: University of Edinburgh
```

### 3. Run MkDocs

Navigate to your main MkDocs documentation project root (the directory containing `mkdocs.yml`) and run:

```
mkdocs serve
```

The plugin will generate the `authors.md` page, and you should see it in your site's navigation.
